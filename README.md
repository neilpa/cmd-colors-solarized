Solarized - Command Prompt theme
=============================================

This is a [Solarized][1] color scheme for the Windows command prompt,
with major contributions by Neil Pankey and Ryan Beesley.

See the [Solarized home page][1] for screenshots and more details,
as well as color schemes for other applications. To contribute or file bug
reports or issues, please visit [the GitHub repo for this port][2],
or the main [Solarized repository][3].

Making Solarized work for cmd.exe, Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, and PowerShell, 
and striking a balance with how other Solarized projects are implemented 
presents some challenges. The following table shows how the colors are mapped.

To make sure that the terminal is likely to use the best matching, the 
ColorTable is aligned with TERMCOL values. These values were pulled from PuTTY 
and other Solarized terminal profiles. This allows the same ANSI escape 
sequences to show the same in ANSI supported terminals. The PowerShell default 
colors are also matched for the $Host.PrivateData and PSReadLine to make them 
seemingly fit with the rest of the environments.

WARNING
-------

Below are very simplified installation instructions. It **will not** update
existing shortcuts because they have their own color mapping. It **will not**
always play nice with traditional unix tools or compatability shims because
Windows uses a fundamentally different color code mapping.

Installation
------------

Import the `.reg` file of choice, e.g. `regedit /s solarized-dark.reg`.

Both files contain the same palettes, the only difference is the default
foreground and background colors. Therefore you can switch between themes on
the fly with `color 01` for dark and `color F6` for light.

Copy the `Set-Solarized*ColorDefaults.ps1` files to your profile directory, 
likely `~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\`. Then add the following line of code 
to the end of your `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` or `profile.ps1`:

    . (Join-Path -Path (Split-Path -Parent -Path $PROFILE) -ChildPath $(switch($HOST.UI.RawUI.BackgroundColor.ToString()){'White'{'Set-SolarizedLightColorDefaults.ps1'}'Black'{'Set-SolarizedDarkColorDefaults.ps1'}default{return}}))

Uninstall
------------

The file `windows-defaults.reg` is provided to restore the command prompt 
colors back to their shipping defaults. The registry settings have been 
checked for versions of Windows back to at least Windows 7 and the values are 
the same.

To restore the defaults, import the `.reg` the same way as you applied it 
previously, `regedit /s windows-defaults.reg`. You will also want to revert 
any changes you made to your PowerShell profile.

__Note:__ the files `solarized-dark.reg` and `solarized-light.reg` are
incompatible with command-line applications that use the Solarized
palette (such as VIM). For correct colors, import either
`solarized-dark-compatible.reg` or `solarized-light-compatible.reg`.
